abstract = {Fume hoods—small but essential safety devices used in laboratory environments—are highly energy-intensive, each one consuming more energy than three homes in an average U.S. climate. Increasing airflow rates in an effort to enhance safety not only elevates energy use but can in fact compromise safety by causing dangerous turbulence that can foil containment. New design strategies have been demonstrated to reduce energy use by 75\%, while maintaining or enhancing safety. The energy savings potential for these hoods across the United States is \$1.5 billion annually. If incorporated in new laboratory construction, high-performance fume hoods can also yield substantial first-cost savings by allowing downsizing of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning infrastructure. However, there are material hurdles to widespread adoption of new fume hood technologies. The problems reside in regulations and standards that stipulate absolute airflow rates, rather than direct metrics of containment and safety.}

abstract = {Fume hoods in laboratories consume the energy equivalent of up to four American households per hood; however, closing a modern hood’s sash completely can save up to 75\% of that energy. Past efforts have attempted to harness this potential energy reduction by reminding users to close the sash when a hood is not in use. In this work, we developed a device to measure the efficacy of these energy-saving methods. The device records the position of the sash and detects motion to determine whether a user is present, and, when fitted with a piezoelectric buzzer, can audibly alert users to close the sash when not in use. We installed this device in laboratories to quantify the energy and cost savings resulting from real-time audible feedback and found that the alarm reduced wasted energy by 87 to 98\%. In addition, the platform demonstrated here can be used to quantitatively test other energy-saving methods that rely on user behavioral change in future work.}

abstract = {The volume of lab exhaust for Engineering Building 1 (EB-1) and Partners III, which are research labs located on North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus, is measured and analyzed. There are three main objectives. The first is to determine how the actual system exhaust compares to the total design capacity of the lab HVAC system. Next, the potential additional savings that would result from carefully keeping fume hoods closed when no one is working in the hood. Then, estimate the actual savings that result from using variable air volume (VAV) fume hoods in place of constant volume (CV) hoods. Lab buildings require much more energy for the HVAC system than other academic buildings because of their high minimum airflow set points, once-through air for supply, and high static pressures for the ventilation system. VAV fume hoods can reduce the HVAC energy requirements by reducing the hood exhaust flow to about one-fourth of the full flow when the fume hoods are closed. However, it is total lab exhaust that drives energy use, and the actual reduction in total exhaust cannot be assumed to be equal to a reduction in fume hood exhaust. This is true in EB-1 because minimum airflow set points are 10-12 air changes per hour (ACH), and a general exhaust box maintains this minimum. Thus, when all 70 fume hoods in EB-1 were closed on Friday evening before the Labor Day holiday in 2005 there was a drop of 14,166 CFM in fume hood exhaust. However, total exhaust dropped by only 8,156 CFM, which is 58\% as much. Therefore, energy savings made possible by closing the fume hoods would be grossly overestimated if the drop in total lab exhaust had been assumed to be equal to the drop in fume hood exhaust. The total exhaust rate was determined to be almost constant at about 68\% of the maximum design airflow for EB-1 during the trended period. The total exhaust was relatively constant over the trended period of about one month because most of the labs were controlled by the minimum airflow set point. The measured exhaust flows for the fume hoods in three Chemistry labs of Partners III indicate that on average 49\% to 65\% of the hoods are open over a two-week period from August 29 through September 11, 2005. These very high values were due in part to a lack of training for the users of the lab. Many students who work in the lab did not understand the importance of closing fume hoods and some in Partners III have been specifically instructed to keep the fume hood sash at 18 inches continually. Potential savings for keeping fume hoods closed when no one is working in the hood were estimated to be \$29,040 per year for EB-1 and \$52,800 per year for the Chemistry labs in Partners III. Additional savings of \$12,310 per year could be obtained for EB-1 if the minimum airflow set point was reduced during unoccupied periods for eight labs where this is most beneficial. Savings for using VAV fume hoods in lieu of CV hoods is estimated at \$58,910 per year in EB-1 and \$42,680 per year in the Partners III Chemistry labs, but this could be increased by the amounts calculated for keeping unused fume hoods closed.}

volume = {127},
year = {2018},
abstract = {Anesthesia, critical care, perioperative, and pain research often involves study designs in which the same outcome variable is repeatedly measured or observed over time on the same patients. Such repeatedly measured data are referred to as longitudinal data, and longitudinal study designs are commonly used to investigate changes in an outcome over time and to compare these changes among treatment groups. From a statistical perspective, longitudinal studies usually increase the precision of estimated treatment effects, thus increasing the power to detect such effects. Commonly used statistical techniques mostly assume independence of the observations or measurements. However, values repeatedly measured in the same individual will usually be more similar to each other than values of different individuals and ignoring the correlation between repeated measurements may lead to biased estimates as well as invalid P values and confidence intervals. Therefore, appropriate analysis of repeated-measures data requires specific statistical techniques. This tutorial reviews 3 classes of commonly used approaches for the analysis of longitudinal data. The first class uses summary statistics to condense the repeatedly measured information to a single number per subject, thus basically eliminating within-subject repeated measurements and allowing for a straightforward comparison of groups using standard statistical hypothesis tests. The second class is historically popular and comprises the repeated-measures analysis of variance type of analyses. However, strong assumptions that are seldom met in practice and low flexibility limit the usefulness of this approach. The third class comprises modern and flexible regression-based techniques that can be generalized to accommodate a wide range of outcome data including continuous, categorical, and count data. Such methods can be further divided into so-called “population-average statistical models” that focus on the specification of the mean response of the outcome estimated by generalized estimating equations, and “subject-specific models” that allow a full specification of the distribution of the outcome by using random effects to capture within-subject correlations. The choice as to which approach to choose partly depends on the aim of the research and the desired interpretation of the estimated effects (population-average versus subject-specific interpretation). This tutorial discusses aspects of the theoretical background for each technique, and with specific examples of studies published in Anesthesia & Analgesia, demonstrates how these techniques are used in practice.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

abstract = {This book focuses on experimental research in two disciplines that have a lot of common ground in terms of theory, experimental designs used, and methods for the analysis of experimental research data: education and psychology. Although the methods covered in this book are also frequently used in many other disciplines, including sociology and medicine, the examples in this book come from contemporary research topics in education and psychology. Various statistical packages, commercial and zero-cost Open Source ones, are used. The goal of this book is neither to cover all possible statistical methods out there nor to focus on a particular statistical software package. There are many excellent statistics textbooks on the market that present both basic and advanced concepts at an introductory level and/or provide a very detailed overview of options in a particular statistical software programme. This is not yet another book in that genre. Core theme of this book is a heuristic called the question-design-analysis bridge: there is a bridge connecting research questions and hypotheses, experimental design and sampling procedures, and common statistical methods in that context. Each statistical method is discussed in a concrete context of a set of research question with directed (one-sided) or undirected (two-sided) hypotheses and an experimental setup in line with these questions and hypotheses. Therefore, the titles of the chapters in this book do not include any names of statistical methods such as ‘analysis of variance’ or ‘analysis of covariance’. In a total of seventeen chapters, this book covers a wide range of topics of research questions that call for experimental designs and statistical methods, fairly basic or more advanced.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
